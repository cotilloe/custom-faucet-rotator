# Bitcoin Faucet Rotator v2

After a few months of coding, development, and security testing, I proudly bring you the second version of the [Bitcoin Faucet Rotator](http://thebitcoinrotator.com) script! The first version can be seen by visiting [https://github.com/rattfieldnz/bitcoin-faucet-rotator](https://github.com/rattfieldnz/bitcoin-faucet-rotator).

This script enables you to start your very own bitcoin faucet rotator, for which you can earn varying amounts of referral income. The main purpose of this script is to allow 'small-time'/beginner bitcoin enthusiasts to earn free bitcoins faster than manually surfing hundreds of bitcoin faucets. With a solid marketing campaign, your referral income is limited only by your potential. If you are new to Bitcoins, you can view [their official documentation](https://bitcoin.org/en/) to find out more. 

This version comes with many extra features - namely:

- Users being able to register their own account.
- Users adding faucets with their own referral codes.
- Users being able to share their own rotators, faucet lists, profile, faucets organised by payment processors.
- Users being able to see Google Analytics stats* of their faucets, without having to register their own G.A account.
- Login and registering protected by ReCaptcha (and a special program which changes captcha scripts at random, on each page load - e.g. SolveMedia, ReCaptcha, and others)
- Admin being able to add, edit, suspend, and permanently delete users.
- Admin being able to add, edit, suspend, or permanently delete main faucets/payment processors.
- Users being able to add/edit/suspend/permanently delete their faucets.
- Admin being able to see a broader range of Google Analytics stats.
- Admin being able to automate sharing of faucets on Twitter (and thus syncing from there to other networks via IFTTT).
- A clean layout with minimal ads (I hate websites that overdo their 'advertising' like spam).
- Admin being able to create privacy policy, terms and conditions, and enable cookie consent (which is required in some countries).

*Google API requests are limited to 50,000 requests per single project per day. Read https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/limits-quotas for further information.

As I am more of a back-end developer, the client-facing design, look and feel of the script is quite 'simple'. While I seem to follow the 'simple is best' approach, I strongly encourage any contribution that will visually enhance this script.
